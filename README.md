# json-server-db-react-todo
Trying to run a json-server database for my React TODO list project on GitHub Pages!

...It didn't work. So I'm going to stick with railway.

btw... [RAILWAY WORKED AGAIN](https://json-server-db-react-todo-production.up.railway.app/)! Rail 2, gh-pages 0!!!

## loopback

When you host to the IP 0.0.0.0 in some host service providers, you can create a loopback.

0.0.0.0 is more like a non-routable address, whatsoever.

127.0.0.1 IP Address - It is a loopback address!
